## 📂 Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for web development experiments. It is designed without a specific single purpose, acting instead as a flexible container for:

- Testing raw HTML files
- Prototyping web concepts
- Serving static assets
- Debugging code snippets

## 🚀 Features

- **Directory Indexing**: Serves as a basic file explorer to easily navigate through various test files.
- **Vercel Integration**: Automatically deployed and hosted on Vercel for instant sharing and access.
- **Minimalist Structure**: No complex build steps or heavy frameworks—just raw web technologies.

## 🔗 Live Access

This project is connected to a custom domain and serves files directly via a directory listing interface.
