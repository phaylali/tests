    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Earth Tones -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page interactive dashboard. The primary navigation is a horizontal timeline of dynasties at the top. Clicking a dynasty dynamically updates the main content area below, which includes a dynasty overview, an interactive ruler chart (Chart.js), a conceptual map, and key insights. This non-linear, hub-and-spoke model was chosen to make a vast amount of historical data digestible and user-driven, allowing exploration by period rather than forcing a linear reading. A special, visually distinct section focuses on the 16th century, using narrative and animated elements to create a more immersive "story mode" for this pivotal era, enhancing engagement. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Dynastic Timeline (Goal: Organize/Navigate): An interactive HTML/CSS timeline to select a period. Interaction: Click. Justification: Provides a clear, high-level overview and acts as the main navigation hub.
        - Ruler Reigns (Goal: Compare/Inform): Chart.js horizontal bar chart. Interaction: Hover for details. Justification: Visually compares reign lengths and succession within a dynasty more effectively than a table.
        - Territorial Maps (Goal: Inform/Compare): Conceptual maps built with styled HTML/CSS divs. Interaction: Hover for labels. Justification: Provides a simplified visual representation of territorial control without relying on static images or complex SVG, adhering to constraints. For the Wattasid/Saadian split, a side-by-side layout clearly shows the division.
        - Battle of the Three Kings (Goal: Explain Change): An animated sequence using HTML/CSS/JS. Interaction: Click to advance steps. Justification: Dynamically illustrates complex troop movements, making the battle's progression easier to understand than static text.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
